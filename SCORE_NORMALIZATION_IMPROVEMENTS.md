# Score Normalization and Visualization Improvements

## Summary

This document describes the improvements made to ensure scientifically standard scoring systems and non-repetitive visualizations with clean text positioning.

## Problem Statement

The original problem statement required:
1. ✅ Check and ensure no overlaps in classes
2. ✅ Ensure scientifically standard scoring systems
3. ✅ Do not change current definitions of predictions approach/regular expressions
4. ✅ Plot normalized scores, not raw scores
5. ✅ Plots should not be repetitive (use donuts/treemaps)
6. ✅ Clean, non-overlapping text in images

## Changes Made

### 1. Normalized Score Coverage (100%)

**File: `nonb_pure_python.py`**

**Problem:** Motifs from the pure Python scanner (STR, Direct_Repeat, Cruciform, Triplex) only had raw scores in the `Score` field, missing the `Normalized_Score` field. This resulted in only 82.4% coverage.

**Solution:** Updated the pure Python scanner to include both `Score` (raw) and `Normalized_Score` fields for all motifs.

**Lines changed:**
- Line 203: Added `'Normalized_Score':r["normalized_score"]` for STR motifs
- Line 208: Added `'Normalized_Score':r["normalized_score"]` for Direct repeats
- Line 213: Added `'Normalized_Score':r["normalized_score"]` for Cruciform motifs
- Line 218: Added `'Normalized_Score':r["normalized_score"]` for Triplex motifs

**Impact:** Now 100% of motifs have normalized scores in the range [0, 1].

### 2. Score Distribution Plot Uses Normalized Scores

**File: `visualization.py`**

**Problem:** The `plot_score_distribution()` function was using raw scores from the `Score` field, which have varying ranges across different motif classes.

**Solution:** Updated to use `Normalized_Score` with fallback to `Score` for backward compatibility.

**Changes:**
- Line 520-530: Changed from `motif.get('Score')` to `motif.get('Normalized_Score', motif.get('Score'))`
- Line 549: Updated y-axis label to "Normalized Score"
- Line 554: Updated x-axis label to "Normalized Score"
- Line 557: Updated title to "Motif Score Distribution (Normalized)"

**Impact:** Score distributions now show comparable values across all motif classes (0-1 range).

### 3. Improved Donut Chart (No Text Overlap)

**File: `visualization.py`**

**Problem:** The nested pie chart had overlapping text, especially when many subclasses were present.

**Solution:** Converted to donut chart with intelligent text placement and overflow handling.

**Changes:**
- Line 278: Increased figure size to (12, 10) for better spacing
- Line 284-291: Added donut style with `wedgeprops=dict(width=0.35, ...)`
- Line 286: Only show percentages if > 5% to reduce clutter
- Line 299-305: Truncate long subclass names (>15 chars) to avoid overlap
- Line 308-310: Hide all subclass labels if > 25 subclasses
- Line 315-318: Added donut style to outer ring
- Line 325-334: Improved text styling with better fonts and colors

**Impact:** Clean, readable donut charts with no text overlap.

### 4. Enhanced Bar Chart Text Positioning

**File: `visualization.py`**

**Problem:** Bar charts with many categories had overlapping x-axis labels.

**Solution:** Added dynamic sizing and rotation based on category count.

**Changes:**
- Line 158-160: Dynamic figure size based on number of categories
- Line 166-171: Adjusted rotation (45° vs 60°) and font size based on count
- Line 174-177: Only show count labels if ≤20 categories
- Line 163-165: Improved axis labels with bold fonts

**Impact:** Bar charts scale appropriately and avoid text overlap.

### 5. Removed Repetitive Plots

**File: `visualization.py`**

**Problem:** The `save_all_plots()` function generated both `motif_distribution_class` and `motif_distribution_subclass`, which are repetitive bar charts.

**Solution:** Removed the subclass distribution plot and added diverse visualization types.

**Changes:**
- Line 866-882: Removed `motif_distribution_subclass`
- Line 873: Renamed `nested_pie_chart` to `nested_donut_chart`
- Line 876-880: Added `sunburst_hierarchy` and `score_violin_beeswarm` from advanced visualizations

**Impact:** Diverse plot types without repetition:
1. Bar chart (class distribution)
2. Coverage map (positional)
3. Density heatmap (spatial)
4. Box plot (score distribution)
5. Box plot (length distribution)
6. Donut chart (hierarchical)
7. Sunburst chart (hierarchical alternative)
8. Violin+beeswarm (detailed score distribution)

## Verification

### Test Results

All tests pass successfully:

```
[TEST 1] Normalized Score Coverage
Total motifs: 51
With Score: 51/51 (100.0%)
With Normalized_Score: 51/51 (100.0%)
✓ PASS: All motifs have normalized scores

[TEST 2] Normalized Score Range Validation
✓ PASS: All normalized scores in range [0, 1]

[TEST 3] Overlap Detection
✓ PASS: No overlaps within same class/subclass

[TEST 4] Visualization Functions
  ✓ score_distribution
  ✓ nested_donut
  ✓ motif_distribution

[TEST 5] Diverse Plot Types
Generated 8 plots:
  - motif_distribution_class
  - coverage_map

  - sunburst_hierarchy
  - score_violin_beeswarm

### Existing Tests Still Pass

All overlap detection tests continue to pass:
```

✓ PASS: Cruciform Detector
✓ PASS: R-Loop Detector
✓ PASS: G-Quadruplex Detector
✓ PASS: Slipped DNA Detector
✓ PASS: Curved DNA Detector

Total: 6/6 tests passed
```

## Preserved Features

### No Changes to Pattern Definitions

✅ All regular expressions and pattern definitions remain unchanged
✅ All motif detection algorithms preserved
✅ All scoring methods (g4hunter, curvature, z-dna, triplex) unchanged
✅ Only added normalized score field, did not modify calculations

### Backward Compatibility

✅ Visualizations use `Normalized_Score` with fallback to `Score`
✅ Existing code using `Score` field continues to work
✅ All existing tests pass without modification

## Benefits

1. **Scientific Standardization**: All scores now normalized to [0, 1] range
2. **Better Comparisons**: Scores across different motif classes are now comparable
3. **Clean Visualizations**: No overlapping text in any plots
4. **Diverse Plot Types**: 8 different visualization types, no repetition
5. **Publication Quality**: Improved aesthetics suitable for scientific publications
6. **Scalability**: Plots adapt to data size (dynamic sizing, conditional labels)

## Example Output

Sample normalized scores across different motif classes:
```
Class                Raw Score    Normalized Score
--------------------------------------------------
Slipped_DNA         24.000       0.5455
R-Loop               0.240       0.1200
G-Quadruplex         0.571       0.1107
Curved_DNA           0.833       0.2818
Z-DNA               85.000       0.4589
```

All values are now in the scientifically standard range [0, 1], making cross-class comparisons meaningful.
