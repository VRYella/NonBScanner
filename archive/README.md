# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documentation and files that are no longer essential for the current architecture but are preserved for reference.

## Archived Documentation Files

### docs/CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md

### docs/NEW_ARCHITECTURE.md
Architecture documentation from the consolidation phase. Most of this information is now integrated into ORGANIZATION.md and other current documentation.

### docs/PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.md
Historical performance benchmarks from the consolidation phase. Current performance characteristics are documented in the main README.md and HYPERSCAN_ARCHITECTURE.md.

## Archived Files

### test_consolidated.py
