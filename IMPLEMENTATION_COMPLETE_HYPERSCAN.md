# Implementation Summary: Hyperscan Integration for NonBScanner

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

This document summarizes the implementation of Hyperscan integration and overlap resolution patterns for the NonBScanner Non-B DNA motif detection system.

---

## Problem Statement Requirements

The task was to implement a comprehensive Hyperscan integration pattern that:

1. **Keeps scientific scoring intact** - Don't compromise scores
2. **Guarantees non-overlapping outputs** - Single, deterministic motif set
3. **Gets best possible performance** - Hyperscan acceleration where available

---

## Implementation

### 1. Core Fix: HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE Definition

**File:** `utils/motif_patterns.py`

**Before:**
```python
class HyperscanManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hyperscan_available = HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE  # ❌ Undefined!
```

**After:**
```python
# Try to import Hyperscan for high-performance pattern matching
try:
    import hyperscan
    HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE = True
except (ImportError, Exception):
    HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE = False

class HyperscanManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hyperscan_available = HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE  # ✅ Now defined!
```

**Impact:** Fixes import errors, enables graceful fallback to pure Python.

---

### 2. Cross-Detector Overlap Resolution

**File:** `utils/utils.py`

Added two key functions following the problem statement's Option A (strict mode):

#### Function 1: `resolve_cross_class_overlaps()`

```python
def resolve_cross_class_overlaps(motifs: List[Dict[str, Any]], 
                                 mode: str = 'strict') -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Resolve overlaps across different motif classes.
    
    Algorithm (mode='strict'):
      1. Sort by score (desc), then length (desc)
      2. Greedily select highest-scoring non-overlapping
      3. Ensures deterministic output
    """
```

**Implementation:** Score-aware greedy selection exactly as specified in problem statement.

#### Function 2: `merge_detector_results()`

```python
def merge_detector_results(detector_results: Dict[str, List[Dict]], 
                          overlap_mode: str = 'strict') -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Merge results from multiple detectors with overlap resolution.
    
    Args:
        detector_results: {'detector_name': [motifs], ...}
        overlap_mode: 'strict' or 'hybrid'
    """
```

**Usage Example:**
```python
results = {
    'a_philic': detector1.detect_motifs(seq),
    'z_dna': detector2.detect_motifs(seq),
    'g4': detector3.detect_motifs(seq)
}
merged = merge_detector_results(results, overlap_mode='strict')
# Returns highest-scoring non-overlapping motifs
```

---

### 3. Verification of Existing Patterns

The codebase already implements the key patterns from the problem statement:

#### A. K-mer Detectors (A-philic, Z-DNA)

**Pattern:** Scan → Merge overlapping k-mers → Score merged regions

**Files:**
- `motif_detection/a_philic_detector.py`
- `motif_detection/z_dna_detector.py`

**Key Methods:**
- `_find_10mer_matches()` - Finds all 10-mers (Hyperscan or Python)
- `_merge_matches()` - **CRITICAL** - Merges overlapping 10-mers into regions
- `_build_per_base_contrib()` - Redistributes scores L/10 per base
- `calculate_score()` - Returns raw sum of redistributed scores

**Verification:** ✅ Implements exact pattern from problem statement

#### B. Interval Detectors (Cruciform, G4, etc.)

**Pattern:** Find candidates → Score → Remove overlaps (greedy by score)

**Files:**
- `motif_detection/cruciform_detector.py`
- `motif_detection/g_quadruplex_detector.py`
- `motif_detection/curved_dna_detector.py`
- `motif_detection/r_loop_detector.py`

**Key Method:**
```python
def _remove_overlaps(self, candidates: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Sort by score (desc), greedily select non-overlapping.
    This is EXACTLY the pattern from problem statement.
    """
```

**Verification:** ✅ Implements exact pattern from problem statement

---

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

**File:** `test_hyperscan_integration.py`

**Tests Implemented:**

1. ✅ **test_hyperscan_availability()** - HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE defined
2. ✅ **test_scoring_separation()** - Scoring separate from scanning
3. ✅ **test_aphilic_detector_merging()** - K-mer merging works
4. ✅ **test_zdna_detector_merging()** - K-mer merging works
5. ✅ **test_cruciform_overlap_removal()** - Overlap removal works
6. ✅ **test_cross_class_overlap_resolution()** - NEW - Cross-class resolution

**Test Results:**
```
======================================================================

======================================================================

Summary:
  • HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE is properly defined
  • Scoring is separate from scanning (scan first, score later)
  • A-philic detector merges overlapping 10-mer matches (17 → 1)
  • Z-DNA detector merges overlapping 10-mer matches (26 → 2)
  • Cruciform detector removes overlaps deterministically (162 → 1)
  • Cross-class overlap resolution works correctly (4 → 3)
  • All detectors output non-overlapping regions

## Requirements Verification

### ✅ Requirement 1: Keep Scoring Systems Accurate

**Implementation:**
- Scoring functions unchanged from literature (G4Hunter, Z-DNA, etc.)
- K-mer detectors redistribute per-base contributions (L/10 per base)
- Normalization applied after aggregation
- `calculate_score()` returns raw scientific score

**Verification:** All scoring algorithms preserved, tests pass

---

### ✅ Requirement 2: Guarantee Non-Overlapping Outputs

**Implementation:**
- K-mer detectors: `_merge_matches()` combines overlapping 10-mers
- Interval detectors: `_remove_overlaps()` greedy selection by score
- Cross-detector: `resolve_cross_class_overlaps()` strict mode

**Verification:** 
- Within-class: No overlaps in detector output ✓
- Cross-class: `resolve_cross_class_overlaps()` ensures single output per region ✓

---

### ✅ Requirement 3: Best Possible Performance

**Implementation:**
- Hyperscan for exact k-mer matching (orders of magnitude faster)
- Compile DB once, reuse for multiple sequences
- Fallback to optimized Python when Hyperscan unavailable
- Merging reduces downstream load (1000 k-mers → 10 regions)
- Adaptive parameters for large sequences

**Verification:** 
- HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE properly defined ✓
- Graceful fallback to Python ✓
- Tests run fast ✓

## Key Design Patterns Implemented

### Pattern 1: Scan First, Score Later
```python
# 1. Hyperscan scans for matches
matches = hm.scan_sequence(seq)  # Fast! Returns coordinates only

# 2. Map to motif metadata
for start, end, pattern_id in matches:
    motif_info = pattern_map[pattern_id]
    
# 3. Compute scores with original algorithms
score = detector.calculate_score(sequence[start:end], motif_info)
```

### Pattern 2: K-mer Merging with Per-Base Redistribution
```python
# 1. Find all 10-mers (may overlap)
matches = detector._find_10mer_matches(seq)  # e.g., 17 matches

# 2. Merge overlapping into regions
merged = detector._merge_matches(matches)  # e.g., 1 region

# 3. Redistribute scores per-base
contrib = detector._build_per_base_contrib(seq)  # L/10 per base

# 4. Score merged region
score = sum(contrib[start:end])  # Sum per-base contributions
```

### Pattern 3: Greedy Score-Based Overlap Removal
```python
# Sort by score (desc), then length (desc)
sorted_candidates = sorted(candidates, key=lambda x: (-x['score'], -x['length']))

# Greedily select non-overlapping
selected = []
for cand in sorted_candidates:
    if not overlaps_any(cand, selected):
        selected.append(cand)
```

## Guarantees Provided

1. ✅ **Deterministic** - Same input always produces same output
2. ✅ **No Duplicates** - Merging/removal prevents split reporting
3. ✅ **Scientifically Accurate** - Literature-based scoring preserved
4. ✅ **Non-Overlapping** - Greedy selection in strict mode
5. ✅ **Fast** - Hyperscan acceleration where available
6. ✅ **Fallback Safe** - Graceful degradation to Python

---

## Performance Characteristics

| Component | Performance | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Hyperscan scanning | O(n) | When available |
| Python fallback | O(nm) | n=seq length, m=pattern count |
| K-mer merging | O(k log k) | k=matches, typically k << n |
| Overlap removal | O(c log c) | c=candidates |
| Cross-class resolution | O(m log m) | m=total motifs |

**Overall:** Linear or near-linear for typical genomic sequences

---

## Next Steps (If Needed)

Potential future enhancements (NOT required by problem statement):

1. **Cache compiled Hyperscan DBs** - Serialize to disk for faster startup
2. **Parallel detector execution** - Run detectors concurrently
3. **Batch sequence processing** - Process multiple sequences in parallel
4. **Alternative merging strategies** - User-configurable merge_gap parameter
5. **Performance profiling** - Detailed benchmarks on genome-scale data
