## üß™ Example Analysis

Use the web interface at `http://localhost:8501` to:
- Upload FASTA sequences or paste sequence data
- Analyze G-quadruplex, Z-DNA, R-loops, and other motifs
- Visualize results with comprehensive charts
- Export findings in BED, CSV, or JSON formats

## üîó Hybrid and Cluster Motif Separation (NEW)

NBDScanner now separates hybrid and cluster motifs from regular Non-B DNA motifs for cleaner analysis:

### What are Hybrid and Cluster Motifs?

- **Hybrid Motifs**: Regions where different Non-B DNA classes overlap (30-70% overlap)
  - Example: `R-Loop_Cruciform_Overlap` - indicates complex genomic regions
  - Shows interaction between different structural elements

- **Cluster Motifs**: High-density regions containing multiple Non-B DNA motifs from different classes
  - Example: `Mixed_Cluster_10_classes` - hotspots of Non-B DNA activity
  - Indicates regions with exceptional structural diversity

### How It Works

1. **Main Results**: Shows only primary Non-B DNA motifs (e.g., 52 motifs)
2. **Cluster/Hybrid Tab**: Dedicated visualization tab for hybrid/cluster motifs (e.g., 71 motifs)
3. **Downloads**: Export files contain only regular motifs for cleaner downstream analysis
4. **Clear Messaging**: Info indicators guide users to the appropriate location

### Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Cleaner Results**: Main results focus on primary motifs
- ‚úÖ **Focused Analysis**: Analyze regular motifs without complex overlaps
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Access**: Hybrid/cluster data still available in dedicated tab
- ‚úÖ **Better Downloads**: Export files contain clean datasets
