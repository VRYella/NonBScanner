# Hyperscan Integration and Overlap Resolution
## Implementation Guide for NonBScanner

This document describes the Hyperscan integration pattern implemented in NonBScanner for high-performance Non-B DNA motif detection with scientifically accurate scoring and deterministic overlap resolution.

---

## Overview

The implementation follows three core principles from the Hyperscan integration plan:

1. **Scan first, score later** - Use Hyperscan for fast pattern matching, compute motif-specific scores separately
2. **Keep raw per-hit contributions** - For k-mer detectors, aggregate all hits with per-base redistribution
3. **Guarantee non-overlapping outputs** - Deterministic selection via score-aware greedy algorithm

---

## Architecture

### 1. Hyperscan Integration Layer

**File:** `utils/motif_patterns.py`

```python
# Hyperscan availability detection
try:
    import hyperscan
    HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE = True
except (ImportError, Exception):
    HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE = False

class HyperscanManager:
    """High-performance pattern matching with Hyperscan"""
    
    def compile_database(self, patterns: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -> bool:
        """Compile patterns once for reuse"""
        
    def scan_sequence(self, sequence: str) -> List[Tuple[int, int, str]]:
        """Fast scanning returns (start, end, pattern_id) tuples"""
```

**Key Features:**
- Compiles Hyperscan database once, reuses for multiple sequences
- Falls back to Python regex if Hyperscan unavailable
- Returns raw match coordinates, NOT scores

---

### 2. Detector-Level Implementation

#### A. K-mer Table Detectors (A-philic, Z-DNA)

**Pattern:** Find all 10-mer matches → Merge overlapping → Score merged regions

**Files:** 
- `motif_detection/a_philic_detector.py`
- `motif_detection/z_dna_detector.py`

**Key Methods:**

```python
def _find_10mer_matches(self, seq: str) -> List[Tuple[int, str, float]]:
    """
    Find all exact 10-mer matches (may overlap).
    Uses Hyperscan if available, else pure Python.
    Returns: [(start, tenmer, score), ...]
    """

def _merge_matches(self, matches: List[Tuple], merge_gap: int = 0):
    """
    CRITICAL MERGING LOGIC - ensures no duplicate/split reporting.
    Combines overlapping/adjacent 10-mers into contiguous regions.
    
    Args:
        matches: List of (start, tenmer, score) sorted by start
        merge_gap: Max gap between matches to still merge (default 0)
    
    Returns:
        List of (region_start, region_end, list_of_contributing_matches)
    """

def _build_per_base_contrib(self, seq: str) -> List[float]:
    """
    Redistribute each 10-mer's score across its 10 bases.
    For 10-mer at position j with score L:
      contrib[j+k] += L/10 for k in [0, 9]
    This allows proper scoring of overlapping matches.
    """

def calculate_score(self, sequence: str, pattern_info: Tuple) -> float:
    """
    Returns RAW sum of per-base contributions in merged regions.
    This is the scientifically accurate score.
    """
```

**Example Flow:**
```
Sequence: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (20 A's)
Step 1: Find matches → 11 overlapping 10-mers at positions 0-10
Step 2: Merge → 1 region [0, 20)
Step 3: Redistribute → each base gets contribution from all covering 10-mers
Step 4: Score region → sum(contrib[0:20]) = total A-philic score
```

#### B. Interval-Based Detectors (Cruciform, Curved DNA, R-loop, G4)

**Pattern:** Find all candidates → Score → Remove overlaps deterministically

**Files:**
- `motif_detection/cruciform_detector.py`
- `motif_detection/curved_dna_detector.py`
- `motif_detection/r_loop_detector.py`
- `motif_detection/g_quadruplex_detector.py`

**Key Method:**

```python
def _remove_overlaps(self, candidates: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Score-aware greedy overlap removal.
    Algorithm:
      1. Sort by score (descending), then length (descending)
      2. Greedily select highest-scoring non-overlapping intervals
      3. Return non-overlapping set
    
    This is EXACTLY the pattern described in the problem statement.
    """
    sorted_candidates = sorted(candidates, 
                               key=lambda x: (-x['score'], -x['length']))
    
    selected = []
    for cand in sorted_candidates:
        if not overlaps_any(cand, selected):
            selected.append(cand)
    
    return sorted(selected, key=lambda x: x['start'])
```

---

### 3. Cross-Detector Overlap Resolution

**File:** `utils/utils.py`

Provides two resolution modes as specified in the problem statement:

#### Option A: Strict Non-Overlapping (Highest Score Wins)

```python
def resolve_cross_class_overlaps(motifs: List[Dict[str, Any]], 
                                 mode: str = 'strict') -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Resolve overlaps across different motif classes.
    
    Algorithm (when mode='strict'):
      1. Sort motifs by score (desc), then length (desc)
      2. Greedily select highest-scoring non-overlapping regions
      3. Ensures single, deterministic output set
    
    Returns:
        Non-overlapping motifs (highest score per region selected)
    """
```

**Example:**
```python
motifs = [
    {'Class': 'G4', 'Start': 10, 'End': 30, 'Score': 0.9},      # G4 overlaps A-philic
    {'Class': 'A-philic', 'Start': 25, 'End': 45, 'Score': 0.7}, # A-philic overlaps Z-DNA
    {'Class': 'Z-DNA', 'Start': 40, 'End': 60, 'Score': 0.8}
]

resolved = resolve_cross_class_overlaps(motifs, mode='strict')
# Result: [G4 (score 0.9), Z-DNA (score 0.8)]
# A-philic dropped because it overlaps with higher-scoring G4
```

#### Option B: Hybrid Annotation (Keep Overlaps)

```python
# Mode 'hybrid' - returns all motifs, hybrid detection happens in scanner
resolved = resolve_cross_class_overlaps(motifs, mode='hybrid')
# Scanner's _detect_hybrid_motifs() annotates overlapping regions
```

**Utility Function:**

```python
def merge_detector_results(detector_results: Dict[str, List[Dict]], 
                          overlap_mode: str = 'strict') -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Merge results from multiple detectors with overlap resolution.
    
    Args:
        detector_results: {'detector_name': [motifs], ...}
        overlap_mode: 'strict' or 'hybrid'
    
    Returns:
        Unified motif list with overlaps resolved
    """
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Single Detector with Merging

```python
from motif_detection.a_philic_detector import APhilicDetector

detector = APhilicDetector()
sequence = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"  # Long A-tract

# Returns MERGED regions only (not individual 10-mers)
motifs = detector.detect_motifs(sequence, "seq1")

print(f"Motifs found: {len(motifs)}")  # Output: 1 (merged region)
for m in motifs:
    print(f"  {m['Class']}: {m['Start']}-{m['End']}, Score: {m['Score']}")
```

### Example 2: Cruciform with Overlap Removal

```python
from motif_detection.cruciform_detector import CruciformDetector

detector = CruciformDetector()
sequence = "ATGCATGC" * 10 + "AAAAAA" + "GCATGCAT" * 10

# Find all inverted repeats (may overlap)
all_repeats = detector.find_inverted_repeats(sequence)
print(f"Raw candidates: {len(all_repeats)}")

# detect_motifs() automatically removes overlaps
motifs = detector.detect_motifs(sequence, "seq2")
print(f"Non-overlapping motifs: {len(motifs)}")
```

### Example 3: Cross-Detector Overlap Resolution

```python
from motif_detection.a_philic_detector import APhilicDetector
from motif_detection.z_dna_detector import ZDNADetector
from motif_detection.g_quadruplex_detector import GQuadruplexDetector
from utils.utils import merge_detector_results

# Run multiple detectors
sequence = "CGCGCGCGCGAAAAAAAAAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG"

aphilic = APhilicDetector()
zdna = ZDNADetector()
g4 = GQuadruplexDetector()

results = {
    'a_philic': aphilic.detect_motifs(sequence, "seq3"),
    'z_dna': zdna.detect_motifs(sequence, "seq3"),
    'g4': g4.detect_motifs(sequence, "seq3")
}

# Merge with strict non-overlapping
merged = merge_detector_results(results, overlap_mode='strict')
print(f"Merged non-overlapping motifs: {len(merged)}")

# Merge with hybrid annotation
merged_hybrid = merge_detector_results(results, overlap_mode='hybrid')
print(f"All motifs (hybrids marked): {len(merged_hybrid)}")
```

---

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Compile Hyperscan Database Once

```python
# GOOD - compile once, reuse many times
hm = HyperscanManager()
hm.compile_database(pattern_list)

for sequence in sequences:
    matches = hm.scan_sequence(sequence)
    # process matches...

# BAD - recompiling every time is slow
for sequence in sequences:
    hm = HyperscanManager()
    hm.compile_database(pattern_list)  # wasteful!
    matches = hm.scan_sequence(sequence)
```

### 2. Merging Reduces Downstream Load

```python
# Without merging: 1000 overlapping 10-mers
matches = detector._find_10mer_matches(long_sequence)
print(len(matches))  # 1000

# With merging: 10 contiguous regions
merged = detector._merge_matches(matches)
print(len(merged))    # 10

# Scoring operates on merged regions (much faster)
```

### 3. Adaptive Parameters for Large Sequences

See `cruciform_detector.py` and `slipped_dna_detector.py` for examples of:
- Sliding windows for sequences > 1000 bp
- Step-size sampling for very long sequences
- Iteration limits to prevent timeout

## Testing

**File:** `test_hyperscan_integration.py`

Run comprehensive tests:

```bash
python3 test_hyperscan_integration.py
```

**Tests cover:**
1. HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE definition
2. Scoring separation (scan ≠ score)
3. A-philic k-mer merging (17 raw → 1 merged)
4. Z-DNA k-mer merging (26 raw → 2 merged)
5. Cruciform overlap removal (162 raw → 1 selected)
6. Cross-class overlap resolution (4 inputs → 3 non-overlapping)

**Expected output:**
```
======================================================================
ALL TESTS PASSED ✓
======================================================================

Summary:
  • HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE is properly defined
  • Scoring is separate from scanning (scan first, score later)
  • A-philic detector merges overlapping 10-mer matches
  • Z-DNA detector merges overlapping 10-mer matches
  • Cruciform detector removes overlaps deterministically
  • Cross-class overlap resolution works correctly
  • All detectors output non-overlapping regions
```

## Scientific Accuracy

### Scoring Remains Unchanged

The implementation preserves all scientific scoring algorithms:
- **G4Hunter** (Bedrat et al. 2016) - G-quadruplex scoring
- **Z-DNA transition** (Ho et al. 1986) - alternating purine-pyrimidine
- **A-philic propensity** (Gorin 1995) - 10-mer log2 odds
- **Cruciform stability** (Lilley 2000) - palindrome characteristics
- **R-loop potential** (Aguilera 2012) - GC skew and content
- All other class-specific scoring functions

### Per-Base Redistribution (K-mer Detectors)

For A-philic and Z-DNA 10-mer tables:
1. Each 10-mer match has a score L (from literature-derived tables)
2. Redistribute: each of the 10 bases gets contribution L/10
3. Overlapping 10-mers sum contributions per base
4. Region score = sum of per-base contributions

This approach:
- ✓ Preserves exact score values from tables
- ✓ Properly handles overlapping matches
- ✓ Produces scientifically reproducible results

---

## Key Guarantees

### 1. Deterministic Output

Given the same input sequence:
- Same matches found (Hyperscan or Python)
- Same merging (deterministic algorithm)
- Same overlap resolution (greedy by score)
- **Result:** Identical output every time

### 2. No Duplicates/Split Reporting

- K-mer detectors: `_merge_matches()` combines all overlapping 10-mers
- Interval detectors: `_remove_overlaps()` keeps highest-scoring non-overlapping
- Cross-detector: `resolve_cross_class_overlaps()` ensures single output per region

### 3. Scientific Validity

- Scoring algorithms unchanged from literature
- Per-base contribution preserves k-mer table values
- Normalization applied after aggregation (as in original papers)

## Troubleshooting

### Hyperscan not available?

System falls back to pure Python automatically:
```python
from utils.motif_patterns import HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE

if not HYPERSCAN_AVAILABLE:
    print("Using pure Python pattern matching (slower)")
    # Everything still works, just slower
```

### Overlapping motifs in output?

Check which mode you're using:
```python
# Strict mode - no overlaps
resolved = resolve_cross_class_overlaps(motifs, mode='strict')

# Hybrid mode - overlaps preserved for biological analysis
resolved = resolve_cross_class_overlaps(motifs, mode='hybrid')
```

### Performance issues on large sequences?

Detectors automatically adapt:
- Cruciform: sliding windows for seq > 1000 bp
- Slipped DNA: step-size sampling for seq > 50000 bp
- All: iteration limits prevent timeout

---

## Summary

This implementation provides:
1. ✓ Fast scanning with Hyperscan (with Python fallback)
2. ✓ Accurate scoring with literature algorithms
3. ✓ Deterministic non-overlapping output
4. ✓ Flexible cross-detector resolution (strict or hybrid)
5. ✓ Comprehensive testing suite
6. ✓ Performance optimizations for large sequences

The pattern is ready for production use in genome-scale Non-B DNA analysis.
