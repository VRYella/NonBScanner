# File Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

The following files were removed as they are not required for the current architecture:

### 1. `nonb_pure_python.py` (268 lines)
**Reason:** Explicitly marked as DISABLED in the recommended `modular_scanner.py` due to O(n³) complexity. 
- Only used in legacy mode of `nbdscanner.py`
- The modular architecture (recommended for production) does not use this file
- Import is wrapped in try/except blocks for graceful degradation

### 2. `qmrlfs_finder.py` (409 lines)
**Reason:** Optional dependency that is not required for R-loop detection.
- Only imported with try/except in `motif_patterns.py`
- `r_loop_detector.py` has its own simplified QmRLFS scoring implementation
- Not part of the core architecture

### 3. `api.py` (276 lines)
**Reason:** REST API component not part of the documented architecture.
- Not imported or used anywhere in the codebase
- Not mentioned in README.md or architecture documentation
- The main application uses Streamlit web interface, not REST API

## Files Updated

### `requirements.txt`
- Removed `fastapi>=0.104.0` (used only by removed api.py)
- Removed `uvicorn[standard]>=0.24.0` (used only by removed api.py)
- Removed `pydantic>=2.0.0` (used only by removed api.py)
- Updated comment to reflect "modular architecture"

## Current Architecture

The cleaned-up architecture now matches the documented structure in `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md`:

```

## Impact

- **Lines of code removed:** 953 lines
- **Files removed:** 3 files
- **Dependencies removed:** 3 packages (fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic)
- **Backward compatibility:** Maintained through try/except blocks
- **Functionality:** No loss of core functionality (removed files were unused or optional)

## Verification

All remaining Python files compile successfully and imports are handled gracefully with try/except blocks where needed.
