# ISSUE RESOLUTION SUMMARY

## Issue Description

**Original Error:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: This app has encountered an error. The original error message is redacted to prevent data leaks. Full error details have been recorded in the logs (if you're on Streamlit Cloud, click on 'Manage app' in the lower right of your app).

Traceback:
File "/mount/src/nonbscanner/app.py", line 9, in <module>
    from utils.nbdscanner import (
    ...<2 lines>...
    )
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was caused by **missing Python dependencies**. The application requires several scientific computing and bioinformatics packages that were not installed in the environment.

### Technical Details

When `app.py` attempted to import modules from `utils.nbdscanner`, the import chain triggered:
1. `utils/__init__.py` → imports from `utils.utils`
2. `utils/utils.py` → imports `pandas` (line 28)
3. `pandas` was not installed → **ModuleNotFoundError**

This is a common issue when deploying Python applications to new environments without first installing dependencies.

## Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Installed Required Dependencies

All required packages from `requirements.txt` were installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Key Dependencies Installed:**
- `streamlit>=1.28.0` - Web framework
- `numpy>=1.21.0` - Numerical computing
- `pandas>=1.3.0` - Data manipulation
- `scipy>=1.7.0` - Scientific computing
- `scikit-learn>=1.0.0` - Machine learning
- `matplotlib>=3.5.0` - Visualization
- `seaborn>=0.11.0` - Statistical plots
- `plotly>=5.17.0` - Interactive plots
- `biopython>=1.79` - Bioinformatics
- `hyperscan>=0.7.0` - Pattern matching (optional)
- `numba>=0.56.0` - JIT compilation (optional)
- `openpyxl>=3.1.5` - Excel export
- `xlsxwriter>=3.2.9` - Excel formatting
- `requests>=2.28.0` - HTTP requests

### Step 2: Verified Installation

Tested all critical imports:

```python
# All imports successful
from utils.nbdscanner import (
    analyze_sequence, 
    analyze_multiple_sequences,
    get_motif_classification_info, 
    export_results_to_dataframe
)
from utils.utils import parse_fasta, gc_content, validate_sequence
from utils.visualization import plot_motif_distribution
```

### Step 3: End-to-End Testing

Ran a complete analysis to verify functionality:

```python
test_seq = 'AAAATTTTGGGGCCCCAAAATTTTGGGGCCCCATGC'
results = analyze_sequence(test_seq, 'test_sequence')
# ✅ Successfully detected 6 motifs
```

## Verification

### Import Test Results
```
✅ utils.nbdscanner imports successfully
✅ utils.utils imports successfully
✅ utils.visualization imports successfully
✅ app.py imports successfully
✅ Analysis functions work correctly
```

### Functional Test Results
```
Test Sequence: 36 bp
Motifs Detected: 6
  - A-philic DNA
  - Non-B DNA Clusters
  - Cruciform
  - (and others)

GC Content: 50.0%
✅ All core functionality working
```

## Deployment Instructions

### For Local Deployment

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/VRYella/NonBScanner.git
cd NonBScanner

# 2. Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Launch application
streamlit run app.py
```

### For Streamlit Cloud Deployment

1. **Ensure `requirements.txt` is in repository root** ✅ (already present)
2. **Push code to GitHub** ✅ (completed)
3. **Connect Streamlit Cloud to repository**
4. **Streamlit Cloud will automatically:**
   - Read `requirements.txt`
   - Install all dependencies
   - Launch the application

**Note:** Streamlit Cloud automatically installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`, so this issue should not occur in cloud deployments.

### For Other Cloud Platforms (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

Include in deployment configuration:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or use dependency management tools:
- Poetry: `poetry install`
- Conda: `conda env create -f environment.yml`

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Document Dependencies Clearly

✅ **Completed:** All dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` with version constraints

### 2. Add Installation Instructions

✅ **Completed:** Created comprehensive documentation:
- `QUICK_START.md` - Step-by-step installation guide
- `TOOL_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete technical documentation
- `README.md` - Already contains installation instructions

### 3. Include Dependency Check

Add to `app.py` (optional, for better error messages):

```python
import sys

def check_dependencies():
    """Check critical dependencies before starting"""
    required = ['pandas', 'numpy', 'streamlit', 'matplotlib']
    missing = []
    
    for package in required:
        try:
            __import__(package)
        except ImportError:
            missing.append(package)
    
    if missing:
        print(f"❌ Missing dependencies: {', '.join(missing)}")
        print(f"📦 Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt")
        sys.exit(1)

# Uncomment to enable dependency check
# check_dependencies()
```

### 4. Use Virtual Environments

**Best Practice:** Always use virtual environments to isolate dependencies:

```bash
# Create
python -m venv venv

# Activate
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   COPY . .
   CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]
   ```

2. **Pin Exact Versions** in `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   # Instead of: pandas>=1.3.0
   # Use: pandas==2.3.3
   ```

3. **Use CI/CD Pipeline** to test installations:
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/test.yml
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - name: Test imports
     run: python -c "import app"
   ```

4. **Add Health Check Endpoint**:
   ```python
   # In app.py
   @st.cache_data
   def health_check():
       """Verify all dependencies are available"""
       # Check imports
       # Return status
   ```
